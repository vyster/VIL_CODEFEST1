AI Powered Customer Profiling Solution :- Exploring how extracted VIL data features can be leveraged for Creating Customer Profiling Solutions through ML/AI techniques.  Solution approach * After noting points mentioned in the PS :- For creating a solution we can start by an ideation of making Knowledge Graphs and Taxonomies between entities (CUSTOMERS). Focus can be on how these and other heterogeneous data sources fit into a flexible architecture that can further build a high level Architecture to create Taxonomies and Knowledge Graphs. We can use the Graph Index and Other representations to tell the Taxonomies, for lets say, a Recommendation System Knowledge Graphs. Knowledge graphs can be made by using XLSX/JSON for better SEO to leveraging taxonomy ie. Combining knowledge graphs and machine learning technologies. * We need to explore the naturally occurring structure of VILâ€™s metadata to come up with an appropriate ontological structure (e.g. creating communities). Using CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT VARIABLES we should be able to identify patterns in the data.
